# Portfolio-Page
This is a portfolio Design Page built by me, it's one of the freeCodeCamp's projects I did, while learning from them.
It's it amazing both in design and very mobile friendly.
This page is built with pure css and html.
The new skills I learnt while working on this project are the: css flexboxs and media quarys.
